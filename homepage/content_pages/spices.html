    <h1>Spices - the basis for the tastiest dishes</h1>
    <img src="./images/spices.jpg" alt="spices" />
    <p>
      If you want to have the best taste of your recipe, is almost always
      recommend buying whole spices and grinding them yourself, since whole
      spices retain their aromatic compounds much better than the ground kind.
      But the reality is that most of us rely on ground spices for convenience.
      Having a mix of whole and ground spices in limited quantities that you’ll
      use up quickly will prevent a bunch of unused spices from languishing in
      your cabinet, losing flavor. <br />
      <br />
      Use whole spices for maximum flavor any time you’re able to grind your
      own, or when adding them—either directly or in a sachet—to braises, stews,
      creams, teas, and other infusions. You can mellow the flavor of whole
      spices like mustard or cumin seed by toasting them in a pan until they
      pop. Use ground spices in applications where you want to disperse a lot of
      flavor: such as in baked goods and spice rubs. Try frying a mix of
      different ground spices in oil or ghee to blend the flavors.

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>
      Spices and herbs are defined as plant derived substances that add flavor
      to any dish. It is difficult to distinguish between the two. Spices can
      come from the following plant parts: roots, rhizomes, stems, leaves, bark,
      flowers, fruits, and seeds. Herbs are typically thought of as non-woody
      plants. <br />

      It is not known when humans began to use the first herbs and spices as
      flavoring agents. Garlic and onions were documented as being used 4,500
      years before present. Humans used spices to help preserve foods before
      refrigeration. Both were also used in religious ceremonies. <br />

      Spices and herbs have historical importance and were once the source of
      great power and wealth. Arab traders established early spice trading
      routes. The Greeks expanded the trade routes to the Mediterranean. The
      Roman Empire had great control and power with the spice trade. Seafaring
      nations like Portugal, Spain, Holland, and Britain entered the lucrative
      spice trade and fought many wars to retain power. As plantations of
      pepper, nutmeg, cinnamon, and other important spices were established on
      tropical islands, the spice monopolies were disbanded.

    <h2>How to Store Your Spices</h2>
    <p>
      Store spices you use often in opaque glass jars or tins in a dark
      cupboard. Spices you don’t use frequently can be stored in airtight
      containers in the freezer. (Remember to bring frozen spices to room
      temperature before opening to prevent condensation.) Label spices with
      their purchase dates, and give them a sniff every few months to make sure
      they’re still pungent. Ground spices tend to oxidize more quickly than
      whole spices due to their large exposed surface area, and will lose their
      flavor within a few months, while whole spices can last up to a year.
      Since we use them in such small amounts, spices should be packed with
      flavor.
