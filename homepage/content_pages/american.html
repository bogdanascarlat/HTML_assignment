    <p>
      American cuisine is one delicacy that’s hard to define, given that it was
      introduced and influenced by immigrants over the early years. From
      Northeast to Mid-Atlantic, Southern to Southwest, the eccentric blend of
      exotic food eventually made America what it is today: a unique myriad of
      steak houses, sandwich shops and burger joints. A true melting pot when it
      comes to staple ingredients – from chicken, wheat, corn, and bread – these
      components are key in just about any quintessential American food. The
      most recognisable ones are the all-time classics such as pizzas, burgers,
      hotdogs and pot pies. However, when it comes to defining the cuisine by
      locality, it is a different matter altogether. <br />
      Pulled pork, shrimp and grits, key lime pie, and lobster rolls are classic
      American dishes you can easily associate with a state or region.

      In addition to foods cultivated across the country, each region has its
      own specialties. The northeastern states of Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont,
      Connecticut, etc. offer plentiful seafood, including lobster and crab, as
      well as the beloved pancake topping maple syrup. <br />The Midwest is
      known for its corn and dairy. Common ingredients in Southern cuisine
      include black-eyed peas, collard greens, okra, sweet potatoes, pecans,
      peanuts, and buttermilk. <br />The South's Cajun and Creole cuisines in
      Louisiana, on the other hand, were heavily influenced by the French and
      distinguish themselves from the rest of the South. Their stews, gravies,
      and other dishes often include the "holy trinity" of bell pepper, onion,
      and celery, as well as rice, cayenne pepper, sassafras. <br />Finally,
      head west and the influence of Spanish and Mexican cuisines becomes
      clear—traditional dishes, such as tamales, tacos, and guacamole, as well
      as Americanized versions (so-called "CalMex" or "TexMex" dishes) are
      popular fare. Sweet and spicy peppers, avocados, cilantro, and other
      typically Mexican/Spanish ingredients are common.
